Hello there.

My name is Ken Rodriguez, I'm currently a student of Southern New Hampshire University. I'm working on my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science with no concentration.

I enjoy programming, cooking, baking, playing video games, and making music. This account is here to act as a portfolio for whatever I've worked on, whether that'd be classwork or personal projects. I hope everything works out.

If you've got questions, comments, or snide remarks, shoot me an email at

kenneth.b.rodriguez@protonmail.com

and I'll try to get back to you. Thanks for popping in, I hope you have a great day.
