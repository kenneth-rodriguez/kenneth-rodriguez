Hello there.

My name is Ken Rodriguez, I'm currently a student of Southern New Hampshire University.
I'm working on my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science with no concentration.
I enjoy programming, cooking, baking, playing video games, and making music. This account
is here to act as a portfolio for whatever I've worked on, whether that'd be classwork or
personal projects. I hope everything works out.
